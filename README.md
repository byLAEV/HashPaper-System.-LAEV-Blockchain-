Technical Document – Request System, Terms, and API for Integration with Amazon (LAEV)
Version: 1.0
Author: LAEV (Lerry Alexander Elizondo Villalobos)

Purpose: This document defines the conceptual architecture, technical foundations, legal guidelines, and operational conditions for implementing a traceability and record‑keeping system anchored to the Bitcoin network. Its goal is to enable interoperability with corporations such as Amazon, using Bitcoin providers (e.g., Hanbot Assist or Proton AMG) as trusted intermediaries for conversion, anchoring, and certification of logistical data.

Executive Summary
The document comprehensively covers:

Essential Terms of Service (TOS).
Description of the operational and cryptographic flow for transmitting metadata and payments.
Structure of the public and private integration APIs.
Standardized label and QR‑code format for verification.
Architecture of the artificial‑intelligence agent called Hanbot Assist.
Security, audit, and governance mechanisms.
A technical schedule that allows delivery of a functional prototype within two months.
The proposed model removes friction between logistics infrastructure and the Bitcoin network by delegating transaction execution to certified providers who return validated information (txid, hash, link, QR) for printing and public blockchain lookup.

1. Terms of Service (TOS) – Fundamental Clauses
Object: The BTC Provider shall supply cryptographic anchoring services on the Bitcoin network at the Company’s request. The service includes receiving metadata and payments, generating valid transactions, and returning verifiable data (hash, txid, link, QR, timestamp) for audit.

Definitions:
Metadata – the structured data set transmitted by the Company.
Hash – the output of a cryptographic function (e.g., SHA‑256).
Txid – the unique identifier of a Bitcoin blockchain transaction.

Technical Scope: The Company determines which fields to include in the hash or OP_RETURN field. Three operational modes may be used:
(a) Dedicated wallet,
(b) Provider‑owned wallet, or
(c) Temporal stamping via OpenTimestamps.

Company Responsibilities: Ensure the validity, legality, and consistency of transmitted metadata and make the agreed‑upon payments.

Provider Responsibilities: Execute transactions according to technical specifications, deliver cryptographic documentation, and retain records for a minimum of twelve months.

Privacy & Data: The Provider assumes no liability for the content transmitted. The Company must refrain from embedding personally identifiable information (PII) in plain text.

Billing & Fees: Fees are contractually stipulated. Payments may be made on‑chain or through escrow mechanisms.

Wallet Management: Use of an audited wallet for traceability is recommended; alternatively, a provider‑managed wallet can be employed for greater confidentiality.

Guarantees: The Provider guarantees transmission, not block confirmation. It is not liable for chain reorganizations or mining‑policy changes.

SLA: Reception confirmation within seconds; block confirmation timing depends on payment priority.

Support & Dispute Resolution: Technical escalation and institutional arbitration.

Modifications: Specification updates will be communicated with reasonable prior notice.

2. General Operational Flow
The Company creates a request containing structured metadata.
It calls the Provider’s API, attaching the metadata and proof of payment.
The Provider validates the payload integrity and executes the Bitcoin transaction.
The Provider returns enriched metadata with hash, txid, and a verifiable QR code.
The Company prints a label that enables direct blockchain validation.
3. Transactional Architecture Comparison
Mode	Advantages	Disadvantages
Company‑Assigned Wallet	Maximum traceability and direct audit	Higher operational exposure and management costs
Provider‑Owned Wallet	Simpler operations and higher confidentiality	Less control over funds and internal records
OP_RETURN / OpenTimestamps	Low cost, no wallet management needed	Size limitation and reliance on external services
4. API Technical Contract
